# Workout Tracker API

This API allows users to manage workout records, including the ability to add, retrieve, update, and delete workouts. It also provides aggregated data and the ability to reset the database.

## Design Decisions
- **Database:** SQLite is used as the database engine due to its simplicity and suitability for small to medium-sized applications.
- **Web Framework:** Flask is chosen for its lightweight and easy-to-use nature, which is ideal for building RESTful APIs.
- **Weather Integration:** OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch current weather conditions, providing relevant context for workouts.
- **Image Storage:** Workout images are stored as binary data in the database, encoded in Base64 format, allowing easy integration with client applications.

## Choice of Tools
- **Flask:** A Python micro-framework ideal for small to medium-sized web applications and APIs.
- **SQLAlchemy:** A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Provides current weather data which is useful for context in workout records.
- **SQLite:** A simple and lightweight database that is integrated with Flask, suitable for development and small-scale production.

## Running the API
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd workout-tracker-api
   ```
3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. **Install the Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Initialize the database by running:
     ```bash
     flask shell
     >>> from app import db
     >>> db.create_all()
     >>> exit()
     ```
7. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Testing the API
- **Manual Testing:** Use tools like Postman or cURL to manually send requests to the API and verify responses.
- **Automated Testing:** Implement unit tests using a testing framework like `pytest` to automate the validation of API functionality.

## Environment Variables
- The application uses OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data. Set your API key as an environment variable named `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`.

```bash
export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY='your_openweathermap_api_key'
```
